% Introduce why machine learning is important and why it has received so much popularity if the last few years.

We live in a dawning age of autonomous vehicles. During the last several years the development of autonomous cars has progressed immensely. Many car manufacturers are currently testing their autonomous car prototypes in real traffic and we can expect to see such vehicles on the market within the near future. At the heart of these autonomous vehicles is the field of Artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the form of machine learning, algorithms that learn.

The concept of machine learning is to create well-adapted AI systems that require the minimal amount of human design. The algorithms learn to predict the correct answers within a certain problem domain by inferring knowledge from examples or from experience (within the domain). 
% Mer om machine learning in general

In autonomous cars, machine learning is used to solve tasks such as steering and image analysis. In order to solve control tasks, such as steering and speed management, the system learns to emulate a specific behaviour by conforming itself to a large set of training examples. The training examples consists of pairs of system inputs, such as sensor data, and the corresponding correct control signals. These sets of training data can be gathered by driving the car while recording both the inputs from all the sensors and cameras on the car, and the control actions taken by the driver. This training process require the recording and quality assurance of vast amounts of example data. INTRODUCERA MÖJLIGHETEN ATT TRÄNA UTAN DATA.

One domain in which this concept (LÄRA SIG RÄJSA MED NEUROEVOLUTION) show some potential is racing. In competitive racing drivers push the physical limits of their cars. The details matter, minute differences in behaviour can accumulate to large time differences. Machine learning could be used to find efficient driving behaviours. There is also the possibility of using machine learning to create the future generation of racing drivers. FIA, the governing body of Formula 1 and many other competitive racing series, has announced a racing series for autonomous cars \cite{roborace}. In the series the teams will use identical cars, except for the software which the teams can modify to gain an advantage. Thus the goal of the competition is to create the most effective autonomous racing system.

%Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a large area of research in computer science for a long time. In 1997 AI research had a major breakthrough, when an AI beat the reigning world champion in chess for the first time ever. Following this breakthrough were AIs such as IBMs "Watson" which beat the two leading world champions in Jeopardy, personal assistants in smartphones such as Apples "Siri" and just recently Google presented an AI that beat a top tier player in the classical game Go.

%AI keeps proving itself to be an important concept in computer science and is thus one that is of great interest to computer scientists. git are many ways in which to approach AI development and in most real world scenarios a combination between several approaches will most likely be the optimal solution. However one area that has received much attention lately is the combination between machine learning and neural networks. This project will aim to research this concept further in order to broaden our knowledge about this area and to examine whether or not a computer can learn complicated behaviours, not only function approximations through machine learning.

%Machine learning in its simplest form, being used to solve a relatively simple problem is not very complicated. However it becomes vastly more complicated when applied to a more complex problem, where a simple rule based solution does not really suffice in order to solve the problem well enough. In order to effectively research machine learning this project will take advantage of this fact. The project will focus around the problem of taking a Formula1 (F1) car as fast as possible around any given F1 circuit, a problem that is very flexible in terms of complexity. This will allow the project to start of with the very basics behind machine learning then by slowly increasing the complexity of the problem we can closely examine the more complex concepts behind machine learning.

\section{Problem}
% Each of the sections needs to be broadened, but it is a start
Driving a car and racing is a complex behaviour that both contain strategic behaviours and driving the car to it's limit to get the best result as possible. The optimal speed and line of the car is different for each car and depends on grip and acceleration, which both depends on various of variables each. It also depends on how the track/environment looks further down. If there is a curve followed by a straight line, the fastest way is to carry as much speed as possible out from the curve. A curve followed by another curve, would instead have to be calculated to have the best position to the next curve. These are just examples of how complex behaviour a race driver do need to have to drive the car to the limit.

The controls of a car are not discrete values, as pedals and steering are continuous values within an interval. This creates a boundary (citation needed) where algorithms and methods that utilises decision trees and discrete states non applicable to the racing domain. 

There are no racing data available from previous races for the research to apply to any machine learning algorithm. If there would have been any data that were available, the virtual domain would have to be set up to match that setup of track, car and environment when the data was performed. This, just as the continuous control values, create boundaries of what methods that can be used (citation needed). There is no sample data to use in the algorithms. 

\section{Purpose}
This report will explore the possibilities of teaching an AI to drive in a racing environment using machine learning. Is it possible to find an effective behaviour from first principles, i.e. without training it to conform to a specific predefined behaviour? Furthermore the possibility of finding sufficiently complex behaviours to drive optimally, both locally and globally, will be discussed. 


\section{Limitation}
% Virtual environment, no real car etc. Customisable physic realism.
    % Simplified physics. Start simple, add more aspects that effect behaviour, when the project is ready for it.
        % Turning radius as a function of speed. More aspects only dealt with in second hand. 2D, tyres.
        % 2D, 3D do not add much conceptual interesting aspects. The parameters change somewhat.. (Problem section?)
% We will only discuss the handling of a single car, ie. the ai will not consider other vehicles or competitive racing strategy. 
% All curves that were used in the 2015 season of Formula1.
% Only evaluate one type of machine learning, instead of comparing many different implementations

% TODO Add reasoning as to why we're not taking racing strategy etc into account.
The scope of this project is limited to finding the optimal behaviour of a race car during a time attack lap. Concepts such as racing strategy, head to head battles between cars, overtaking and pit stops will not be considered when evaluating optimal behaviour.

Aspect that affect the prolonged operation of the car, such as fuel efficiency, tyre wear and break temperatures will 

Thus concepts such as racing strategy, head to head battles, overtaking and pit stops will not be considered when evaluating optimal behaviour. Neither aspects affecting the prolonged operation of the car such as fuel efficiency, tyre wear or break temperatures will be considered.

Finding the optimal behaviour will be done using machine learning. There are many different implementations of machine learning that could potentially find the cars optimal behaviour. Potentially many implementations could even work in parallel to improve performance even further. However, for time-related reasons, this project is limited to using and evaluating one machine learning implementation and it's usefulness within this area. 

The AI will operate within a virtual environment in order to increase the flexibility of the car and its environment compared to operating a car in the real world. However operating within a simulated environment requires the existence of such an environment. This project aims to develop its own simulator, in order to have full control of the environment. The simulator will however be very limited, and will only include parameters that are of great importance to the cars behaviour. This includes parameters such as turning radius as a function of speed, however it does not include internal dynamics of the car or tyre grip that varies with temperature.

% The scope of this study is limited to finding behaviours for single cars only competing with the clock in a simulated environment. Head to head racing scenarios or strategies will not be taken into account. The sole purpose will be to optimise the lap times of a single vehicle. Aspects affecting the prolonged operation of the car such as fuel efficiency and tyre wear will also be excluded. 

% Physical effects that are complicated to simulate and of negligible importance to the general behaviour of the car will not be taken into account. This includes concepts such as tyre grip that varies with temperature in the tyres and on the track, internal dynamics of the car.
