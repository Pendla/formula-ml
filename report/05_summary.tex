\chapter{Conclusion}

This chapter will conclude this report with a summary and discussion on the implications of the results. Possible areas of future work and extensions to the project will also be discussed.

\section{Summary}


\section{Future work}


There were many ideas of interesting topics and possible extensions found throughout the project. In this section questions that we found interesting bu were left out of the report will be discussed. 



Ideas: (Some should maybe be discussed in this report?)

- Combine it with another algorithms that is more efficient for finding new weights, like co-evolution? Maybe not possible due to the structure of neat? Has co-evolution the problem with bad innovation management, is that a problem?

- Increase effectiveness with some aspects of learning with a teacher. I human often learns that properties are good, and train to fulfil properties, that in turn effect the end goal result. The end goal result is maybe not neglected at all, but may be temporary in the process of achieving a property.

- What kinds of logical operators can be achieved by structures of neurons that use the sigmoid function. Could neat benefit from adding complete micro structures?
