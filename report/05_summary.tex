\section{Summary}

\section{Future work}
Ideas: (Some should maybe be discussed in this report?)

- Combine it with another algorithms that is more efficient for finding new weights, like co-evolution? Maybe not possible due to the structure of neat? Has co-evolution the problem with bad innovation management, is that a problem?

- Increase effectiveness with some aspects of learning with a teacher. I human often learns that properties are good, and train to fulfil properties, that in turn effect the end goal result. The end goal result is maybe not neglected at all, but may be temporary in the process of achieving a property.

- What kinds of logical operators can be achieved by structures of neurons that use the sigmoid function. Could neat benefit from adding complete micro structures?
