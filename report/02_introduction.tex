\section{Background}
Necessity of machine learning
Many other techniques are insufficient

\section{Problem}


\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this project is to determine whether or not machine learning can be used in order to create an AI capable of driving a car around a F1 circuit as fast as possible in a virtually simulated environment. The result will be used to examine the possibilities and limitations of various machine learning techniques, be that whether the AI will succeed in driving the car around the circuit or not.
