This paper presents a study of how a simulated race car would behave by learning how to drive a predefined track by reinforcement learning. Racing is a complex and continuous domain, with a lot of variables that are useful in different scenarios, and some variables that may be in excess. The paper describes an evolutionary algorithms NEAT that have been adapted to fit the race simulator and domain. It also focuses on search space reduction to speed up learning and computation.
