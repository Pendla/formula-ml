## General information


## Agenda
### Brainstorm of new techniques to try out
- Q-learning
- Tile
- Heuristics fitness, current ideas: some crashes before other
- Alternative fitness functions in NEAT, different heuristics 
- Use of multiple networks for different purposes. Feed in to each other?

### Brainstorm of experiment to do
One thing that should be done soon is to run experiments for longer periods of time, maybe 10 000 - 100 000 generations. Create a test suite that tests multiple times?
- One or two curves only: not as much to loose when testing new behaviour as if the track is long and complicated. Hopefully reach a more complex behaviour.
- Multiple short track tests: Failure in one, let it still do and progress in subsequent turns. Be cautious of parameters, so that it is not beneficial to ignore some part.
- Narrow track with brake enabled: Small variation of possible racing lines, focus on achieving good braking.
- Search for better racing lines: Fixed speed? Count fitness to a good racing line? Give a good racing line as in data?

### Discussion of the design of Experiment and visualisation

### Bugfixes
