# Meeting 160126
## Web page & Documentation
Add missing information to web page.
* Mails to Prasad
* Status report
* Pert-chart
* Requirements
* Use-cases - For the AI & Simulator.

## Simulation
* What kind of simulation?
* Will simulate in discrete steps, not continuous, might be problem. Might have to add ad hoc corrections.
* How to simulate differential equations?

## Related problems
* Search for other similar problems and projects. For instance cycling, motorcar.
* If we say that there is not any other work in this area, and it subsequently turns out to exist,
 we will look very bad!
* Can we explore other related or unrelated problems? How does a simulation handle a planetary orbit, numerical problems? Would an AI. be able to predict the path?
* If the car is constantly pulling to the left, what will the simulation do? Will it succeed to turn in a circle, or will it be a spiral?

## Todo
* We need to get something up and running very very fast!
* Solve the simplest problems first.

## Q: Language?
````
A: What libraries are available? The language that gives us the least amount of headache.
