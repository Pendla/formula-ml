Hi again!

We couldn't find 2515 E so we booked 5205 at 08:00-10:00. This is an hour earlier than planned, but I think the other group can do a meeting at 08:00. 

Best regards
/Jonathan

Hi!
I have no clue, but I'm going on a scavenge hunt for it tomorrow. It was one of two rooms being free

Hi!

There were quite few rooms left but we've booked 2515 E. It would be good If you could find a better room, but otherwise 2515 E will suffice.

Best regards

OK, thanks for the info.  Could you guys book a room from 0900-1100 for next Tuesday, please?   Let me know the room, and I’ll use it for my other group as well.

Mvh

Hi!

Sorry for the delay. We will not be needing any meeting this week, but next Tuesday would be great; will you book a room for us or should we book something? 

Best regards

Hi Jonathan,

Sorry to rush you guys, but I would appreciate a quick answer to my question:  do you want a meeting this week, and if so, would Thursday 0800 do?  (We have a room).   If not, I guess we revert to next Tuesday as usual.

Mvh
Prasad
