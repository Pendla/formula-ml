Thanks, Jonathan!  By the way, can we make this a convention?  (That you guys book the room when we set a time for a meeting?)

9-11 is a tough time to book, since the usual slots are 8-10 and 10-12.  I am open to new times if you guys would prefer that.

Hi!

We can't book rooms any further than 4th of april but we'll gladly take a meeting on the 5th and book a room when they are available for booking. We'll keep you posted when we can book a room. 

Best regards
/Jonathan

Hi,

Shall we meet Tuesday 5th April from 09:00 to 10:00 for the data structures group and from 10:00 to 11:00 for the car group?  I’m afraid my inability to book rooms looks like a long term problem with no solution in sight, so can I request you to book a room or rooms, please?  (Both groups don’t need to meet in the same room).

Mvh
