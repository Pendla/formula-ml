# Meetings with Prasad

# Meeting 160126
## Web page & Documentation
Add missing information to web page.
* Mails to Prasad
* Status report
* Pert-chart
* Requirements
* Use-cases - For the AI & Simulator.

## Simulation
* What kind of simulation?
* Will simulate in discrete steps, not continuous, might be problem. Might have to add ad hoc corrections.
* How to simulate differential equations?

## Related problems
* Search for other similar problems and projects. For instance cycling, motorcar.
* If we say that there is not any other work in this area, and it subsequently turns out to exist,
 we will look very bad!
* Can we explore other related or unrelated problems? How does a simulation handle a planetary orbit, numerical problems? Would an AI. be able to predict the path?
* If the car is constantly pulling to the left, what will the simulation do? Will it succeed to turn in a circle, or will it be a spiral?

## Todo
* We need to get something up and running very very fast!
* Solve the simplest problems first.

## Q: Language?
````
A: What libraries are available? The language that gives us the least amount of headache.

##Create a website
	• Mobile phone numbers for the complete group
		○ e-mail, primary
		○ In every e-mail, attach the link to the website
	• Project diary
		○ Minutes of meeting with Prasad
		○ Weekly progress
	• Project proposal
		○ Copy from whereever it is
	• Planning report
		○ At the end of January (possibly first week of February)

Create a plan, even though it will change, failing to plan is planning to fail
Deadlines of what is going to happen when
		
		
##Deliverables
	• The report
	• Code/system
	• Presentation
		○ Poster
		○ Audio/visual presentation
	• Bibliography
		○ Students are really bad at this, note everything you read
			§ Annotated

##The report
	• Title
	• Abstract
		○ 10 lines
	• Elevator pitch
	• One page summary
	• Interview
		○ Chalmers students are better at talking than writing.

Start small, really small

###Bibliography
	• Annotated
		○ Question, answer of source, relevance?
	• Peer reviewed - edited

###Code/system
	• Weekly build
	• As high level language as possible

Breakdown to subproblems
Add more important things to the Bibliography, arbritrary webpages are not enough. 

Simpify the problem
	
ALWAYS have something up to date, always iterate rather than do the work in a bunch

If we want Prasad to do something, bring material hand he will do it in our pressence.
