# Meeting 160425

#### Participants
* Gabriel Alpsten
* Daniel Eineving
* Martin Nilsson
* Simon Petersson

## General information


## Agenda

### 1. Stand up
* What have been done?

#### Simon
* Bugs
* Thinking about path algorithm

#### Martin
* Bugs
* Rendering curve trail, colour scheme by speed.
#### Gabriel
* Experiment with many simulations
* Experiment with different tracks
#### Daniel
* Car steering
* Car acceleration and retardation

### 2.Discussion topics

#### Car behaviour
* Remove slowpoke, makes evaluation go so much slower

Average speed * time? Would this give a better time handling in the fitness function?
Checkpoints?

### 3. Weekly goals

#### Code
* Statistics (Daniel)
* Remove slow avarage speed (Daniel)
* Saved images
* Put up Trello (Daniel)
* Last weeks coding and remove slow car generations with checkpoints (Simon)
* Mirror experiment (Gabriel)
* Wide, shortest distance (Gabriel)
* Narrow, optimise speed (Gabriel)

* More data from simulation: average speed and car distance

#### Report
* Method
    * What experiments have we performed, and what are their purpose?
    * What kind of data we visualise.
* Get an overall structure

#### Research
* Find someone who have had the same fitness problem with minimising time
* Read at least one paper.
* Find at least one source.
