### Debuging         
Only what we need ourselves. 

### Presentation reflection
Got bad questions. We have a difficult topic. Need to consider this in later presentations. One suggestion is to focus more on reinforcement learning, how it works what we do. But all this is probably easier when we now exactly what we have done. 

One question: "How is this programmed?"
