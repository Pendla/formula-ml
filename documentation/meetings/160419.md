## General information

Status for everybody? Tasks in progress?

### Gabriel
much to say
plan things to do (have talked about it already)
design of experiments
track design



## Agenda

### Planning suggestion (Gabriel)
Some things to do, possibly most of it this week, depending on other work load

 - Concerning training with more time, do we need to build something?
   - Fail management?
   - Log statistics for each generation
 - Test a single curve and few curve track. If this do not work, we really need to understand why!
   - Variation of curves
   - Variation of track width (to focus testing on steering and braking)
 - Modular network paper seems interesting and a low hanging fruit:
   - Combine fitness from several different simulations / alternate between simulations
   - Simple with the new refactoring I will mention later
   - Have not read the paper myself, Martin, what do you think?
   - Will we need to analyse network characteristics too? Next week?
Requires presentation of the following sections by Gabriel.

 - Formal test procedures?
 - Visualisation of racing lines
 - Fix things in NEAT (Martin)
 - Other tasks?

### Refactor / Design of experiments (Gabriel)
Notes:
ExperimentWindow (whiteboard, draw to the left)
 - Resposibility: Handle visualisation previously made by CurveDataExperiment
 - Previously: light weight SimulationState.
 - Creates a window, implements a state
 - Operations: creation (takes a simulator), updateNetwork()
 - Thread safe

NeatTrainer (right)
 - As before
 - Resposibility: Algorithm
 - Require a network evaluator, NeatEvaluator (draw too)

SimulationEvaluator (lower middle)
 - Resposibility: Setup & run simulation
   - track
   - car
   - give result: default fitness / SimulationResult
 - Resposibility: Setup ai, define input/(output) processing
   - Everything we implement
   - Enable/disable with flags
 -
 - Parameters, input struct.
 - Counts inputs (and outputs)
 - Can copy itself. Usage: Create one, then call make_factory()
 - Fit with NeatTrainer as it is, implements NeatEvaluator

Using SimulationEvaluator
 - Do a new implementation of NeatEvaluator
 - Example: Use SimEvaluators, but with different fitness function
 - Example: Use multiple SimEvaluators for the same evaluation. 
   - Parameter structs reusable
 - Example: Alternate between different SimEvaluators



### Thought on track design and experiments (Gabriel)
Categorise curves by behaviour:

Examples of single right turns
- Medium speed, outer: 90 degree turn that require slight braking and a positioning far to the left
- Low speed, outer: Hairpin
- High speed, outer: Kink in a straight that do not require the driver to brake at all
- High/medium speed, inner: a slow turning curve, where one can drive the shortest path at maximum speed.

Examples of right-left curves
- Medium speed, outer for both turns: Two rather separated curves that essentially is to single curves
- Medium speed, outer for the first, middle for the second: Two close curves

Questions, further study: How helpful is this? Does it work in micro scale?



### Summary tasks
#### Helping features
- Training statistics (Daniel)
 - Average result
 - Best
- Graphics trail (Martin)
- Neat, fully connected option (Martin)

#### Fixes
- Implement car to new refactor (Daniel)
- Fix car control, cap not scale (Daniel)
- Variants of output implemented in SimulationEvaluator? No, only full control for now

- Dist & mid -> Dist two edges (Simon)
- Checkpoint, track loading problem (Simon)

#### New experiments
- Design short tracks (Gabriel) DONE
 - Analyse the overall simulation implementation.
 - Make models (Martin)
 
- Implement experiment structure for multiple / alternating tracks (Gabriel) DONE
 

### Discussion results
* Change input from "distance to middle" to "distance to edges". Should handle positioning better and tracks with changing width.  
* Fix checkpoint problems, and give start/finish the ability to not be the same position.
* Car setup and simulator setup is the main factor to how a curve should be taken, and therefore what curves that might be interesting.
