# Techniques 

### NEAT

### NEAT with heurustics?

### ESP?
Mentioned as a preceeding algorithm to CoSyNE

### Q-learning
Appears often together with reinforcement learning in the context of Markov decision problem

### Dynamic programming
Appears often together with reinforcement learning in the context of Markov decision problem

### Linear programming
Said to scale badly when the state space become large, for example a continius space (CoSyNE paper)




# Top priority papers
### Deep learning in neural networks: An overview 
(Simon)
Hot paper & Highly cited
Review of a number of different algorithms
cited Evolving Neural Networks through augmenting topologies

### Combining NEAT and PSO for learning tactical human behavior
Probably discusses relevant problems concerning planning and strategy! Discusses an algorithm called PIGEON.

### Incremental Evolution of Complex General Behavior
Different domain but might have some good thoughts in general.
Gabriel: Incremental evolution in some way is necessary to obtain complex behaviour.

### Neural Modularity Helps Organisms Evolve to Learn New Skills without Forgetting Old Skills
Might be relevant in an incremental training process. In this method one change the resistance of nodes to change. This supposedly lead to faster learning of new tasks and a preservation of old learned knowledge.




# Probably relevant papers
### Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms
A book

### An application of Reinforcement Learning to Aerobatic Helicopter Flight
This problem may share the same kind of unprocessed output data as we hope to use

### Behaviour transfer for value-function-based reinforcement learning
Might have some insights to how reinforcement learning and ANN works

### Evolutionary Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning
Uses a combination of NEAT and Q-learning. Interesting to see how they relate Q-learning to NEAT
