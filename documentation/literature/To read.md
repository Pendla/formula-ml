# Techniques 
### NEAT

### Q-learning?
Appears often together with reinforcement learning

### Dynamic programming
Appears often together with reinforcement learning

### Linear programming



# Relevance now
### An application of Reinforcement Learning to Aerobatic Helicopter Flight
This problem may share the same kind of unprocessed output data as we hope to use

### Behaviour transfer for value-function-based reinforcement learning
Might have some insights to how reinforcement learning and ANN works

### Evolutionary Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning
Uses a combination of NEAT and Q-learning. Might be interesting

### Opposition-Based Learning: A New Scheme for Machine Intelligence
"Possibilities for extensions of existing learning algorithms are discussed"




# Relevant if we modifies the problem by adding more intelligent input/output processing
### Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Uses ai to forecast a value for different alternatives.

### Reinforcement Learning of Local Shape in the Game of Go
Fragments a large problem in many parts
