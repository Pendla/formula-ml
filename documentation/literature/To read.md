# Techniques 

### NEAT

### NEAT with heurustics?

### ESP?
Mentioned as a preceeding algorithm to CoSyNE

### Q-learning
Appears often together with reinforcement learning in the context of Markov decision problem

### Dynamic programming
Appears often together with reinforcement learning in the context of Markov decision problem

### Linear programming
Said to scale badly when the state space become large, for example a continius space (CoSyNE paper)




# Top priority papers

### Accelerated neural evolution through cooperatively coevolved synapses
(Gabriel)
published 2008
Compares a neuroevolution method called Cooperative Synapse Neuroevolution (CoSyNE) to other reinforcement algorithms.
Benchmark tests the pole balancing problem.

Notes:
Introduction: Problem targeted (1.) non-linear and noisy, difficult to engineer a models, (2.) and complex so it is difficult to find reasonable first control strategy.
Dynamic programing scales bad when the state space increases, for example continuous world.


### Efficient non-linear control through neuroevolution
Also discusses CoSyNE and the pole balancing problem

### Incremental Evolution of Complex General Behavior
Different domain but might have some good thoughts in general.
Gabriel: Incremental evolution in some way is necessary to obtain complex behaviour.



# Probably relevant papers
### Neural Modularity Helps Organisms Evolve to Learn New Skills without Forgetting Old Skills
Might be relevant in an incremental training process. Dependant on stimuli, nodes take on different resistance to change.

### An application of Reinforcement Learning to Aerobatic Helicopter Flight
This problem may share the same kind of unprocessed output data as we hope to use

### Behaviour transfer for value-function-based reinforcement learning
Might have some insights to how reinforcement learning and ANN works

### Evolutionary Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning
Uses a combination of NEAT and Q-learning. Interesting to see how they relate Q-learning to NEAT
