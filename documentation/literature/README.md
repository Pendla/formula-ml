## Papers

#### Introduction to the Theory of Neural Computation
Introductory paper to neural networks.

#### Evolving Neural Networks through augmenting topologies
This is the paper upon which MarI/O is based.

*So why waste valuable effort permuting over different topologies?*
````
The answers provided thus far are inconclusive. Some have argued that network
complexity can affect the speed and accuracy of learning (Zhang andMuhlenbein,1993).
Although this assertion is true for the backpropagation algorithm, it is not clear
whether it applies when weights are being optimized by evolution and not backpropagation.
````

An argument for using the method that applies to us. 
````
A persuasive argument for the evolution of both topology and weights was put
forward by Gruau et al. (1996), who claimed that evolving structure saves the time
wasted by humans trying to decide on the topology of networks for a particular NE
problem.

## Articles

#### The Racing Ling + Driving Corners Fast
http://www.drivingfast.net/techniques/racing-line.htm
http://www.drivingfast.net/techniques/track-corner.htm
Easy guide for racing theory. Useful for discussing level of physically correctness and judgement of ai result.

#### The Physics of Racing
Brian Beckman, Reformatted 25 April 2008
A series of articles. Quite informal and somewhat disconnected structure. Possibly useful for future reference.
