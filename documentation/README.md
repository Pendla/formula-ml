Poke and change networks manually
## Experiments
### Supportive features
- Instead of killing the simulation when it crashes, give it a penalty but let it continue? Reset the position?
- Can we give the car some kind of warning? E.g. a dangerous curve ahead.
- Test suits
  - Test for longer periods of time. 
  - Test multiple times

### General test procedure
- Multiple short track tests. Failure in one, let it still do and progress in subsequent turns. Be cautious of parameters, so that it is not beneficial to ignore some part.
- Alternating multiple short track tests. May produce modular networks?

### Behaviour specific 
- One or two curves only
- Narrow track with brake enabled: Small variation of possible racing lines, focus on achieving good braking.
- Search for better racing lines: Fixed speed? Count fitness to a good racing line? Give a good racing line as in data?

## Think
Can we reduce other problems to the racing problem?
