## Planning report
### Pert Chart
We need to make some plan with time. It doesn't have to be correct, but a plan is needed in order to proceed.

## Simulation programmings
Looks good, but we should not make the simulation to complicated. Keep it simple.

## Requirements
Create use cases and use them in order to create requirements. Which if we want we can boil down to an actual specification. What do we want our program to do in 4-5 months?

## Happening right now
### Inputs & Outputs

### General AI
When we decide to simplify things, we should provide "hooks" for future projects to easily use our project in order to make a more complicated simulation and AI.

## Neural networks
Why neural networks? We should motivate why we chose to work with neural networks. Or present our work as "Are neural networks good enough to solve our problem?"

## Happening this week
We should work on simulation, XOR network and planning report in parallel. We need to work with some kind of "breadth first search" since we don't know which methods will work and which will not.
