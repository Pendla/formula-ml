# Meeting 160511

#### Participants
* Daniel Eineving
* Martin Nilsson
* Simon Petersson
* K.V.S. Prasad

## Report
* Avoid phrases like "This section", "This paper" etc.
* Literary -> Literature
* Bibliography, physics of racing should be one reference. Instead put parts when actually refering to the bibliography in the text.
* If we are to speculate in further research and how stuff could be done. We have to provide results that prove that we have made an educated guess.
* Talk briefly about cloud computing in the method and that it provides us with more data to base our results and discussion on.
* Might not be worth to always avoid we. But a way around using we is using the imperative.

## Experiments
* Prasad thinks we should spend time on manually modifying a network. The reason being that it adds another dimension to our report.
* Flip the track and present the results of the car driving counter-clockwise.
