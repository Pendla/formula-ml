#Notes
Prasad mentioned the biologist Uri Alon that alternated the requirements between left and right. That resulted in a modular network. He suggested a paper on the matter

Reminder of suggention: Poke and do changes in the network. See what happends, and if it it something to learn.

Prasad said it is worth mentioning that we got result after so few generations (<100). 

Prasad mentioned that Dag had said that evolutionary algorithms often require the performance from low lever languages. We are in good shape right not, not necessary to focus on more.

Prasad mentioned a program written by Richard Dawkins. It presented a rapid evolutionary development. Maybe look in to that matter, fast evolving/changing stuff.

Can we reduce other problems to the racing problem? 

Instead of killing the simulation when it crashes, give it a penalty but let it continue? Reset the position?

Can we give the car some kind of warning? A dangerous curve ahead
