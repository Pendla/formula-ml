Some times one do not understand what the situation 

Write down the situation where we can see how the input affect the behaviour.

What does it mean when the ai understand something? Can we see how it learns?
Analyse the layers

What happens if we take something away from the network, can we learn something of how it works? Think of biologists. Prasad suggest that we put some effort in to this kind of analysis, but in second hand if other experiments are more important. In the report, even if we fail, mention that we tried.


## Report
Keep a report running. 
Suggestion: have a section in the report where we comment different. Possibly the part that will be read most. 
Keep the text short in the beginning. Get the structure out! Write an abstract.
Interview each other! If we have problems with writing, just write down what the person said.


## Team work
Kidz playing football, everyone is where the ball it. But it may be useful to use the space.
