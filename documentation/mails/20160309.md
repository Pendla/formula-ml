OK, so we won’t meet tomorrow - sorry about your wasted room booking.  But we can meet briefly this afternoon at 1630 at my office 6124.  Let me know if that works for at least some of you.  My phone number is 0736 30 28 22 if you need to reach me late.  I’m in a meeting 1515 - 1615.

I’m not in every day (I work half time), so it would be better if you could fix the time with me.  I wasn’t planning to be in Thursday.  But let me check with the other group and get back to you.
