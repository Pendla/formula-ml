By the way, you are meant to be giving me your self-assessments. Put you assessments all in one envelope, and slip it under my door.

Also, if you haven’t already done so, write down (each of you) your recollections and reflections on the presentations last week, of questions that arose.  Having seen the other groups’ progress gives you a better idea of how well you are doing.  Then pool your notes and memories. 

See you later in the week, or next week latest.

Subject: SV: Are we meeting tomorrow? Where?

The weekly bookings you made have reached the end date. Our group does not have any room booked yet. Two of our group members are sick today, but I suggest that we meet at 6128, but if it is occupied we sit down in Linsen or someplace quiet.

Hi,

Both groups: are we meeting tomorrow?  Many weeks ago, I sent out mail saying which weeks we had a room booked.  I can’t seem to find it.  Please tell me if we have a room tomorrow.  If not, and you want to meet, can you please book one?  My Outlook program is not letting me do that.

Mvh
