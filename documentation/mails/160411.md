Hi!

We do not need to meet this week, as we have not done as much since last time.
Sorry for the late response, I've been away this weekend. 

Regards Daniel

Hi Jonathan,

Your group should see me Tue 12 Apr in the morning.   Say 11:00?  Please book a room and tell me the number.

Daniel, if your group wants to meet, tell Jonathan when (10?), and maybe we can use the same room for both.  Let me know whether we are meeting.

Mvh
Prasad
