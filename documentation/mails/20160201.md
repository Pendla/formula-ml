Hi Prasad!
Two of our groupmembers (including me) are sick and not in school today and most likely not tomorrow either. In addition to this we do not feel like there are a lot of questions from our side this week, as we are still working on what the administration wants and what you told us last week. Therefore we feel like we should not meet tomorrow and not waste your time as we might need your guidance even more further on. I hope that this is possible and that it does not create any inconvenience for you. Please reply as soon as possible.

Best regards
Daniel Eineving
