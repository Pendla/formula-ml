Hi Prasad! The best thing for us would be to have the meeting on Wednesday or Thursday. Anytime during Wednesday before 16:00 or after 12 at Thursday would suit us just fine. Is this possible to get?

Best regards
Daniel Eineving

Hi all,

I get in late Monday night, and it seems too optimistic to schedule meetings for 9 am on Tuesday.  Also, I have urgent meetings until Thursday, so could we please stay flexible?

Friday, except for 1300-1400 seems a safe bet for now.  About earlier, I’ll get back to you after I’ve had a chance to settle back in.

Please tell me when you guys can/can’t.   Since this is primarily to catch me up, maybe it doesn’t have to be the entire group, though that’s obviously preferable.

Mvh
Prasad
