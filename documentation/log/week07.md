## Gabriel

### Track curve
Implemented a indata preprocessor that takes the length and angles to the next number of checkpoints.

### Heykin
One often want the network to be able to handle invariants of a class. The structure of the network may impose the same result different invariants. Example from image processing. The same recognition pattern structure is repeated, translated and rotated. [Comment, is this not what convolutional neural net is about?]

Two types of stored knowledge, page 57: Declarative: knowledge defined with symbols. Procedural: The "knowledge" is embedded in the executable code.

Dynamic programming is often used in conjecture with reinforcement learning in the realm of Markov Decision Problems. Q-learning also relate MDP.
