Something seemed weird with the distance calculation. If the progress timeout was increased, the performance of the trained network increased.

### Notes: Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies
In section 6, the paper mentions a concept called Incremental Evolution. It is about increasing the difficulty of the task as the ai evolve. Neuro evolution is likely to get stuck on a local optimum if the problem is too hard. If one let is solve a simple problem first, that will probably produce a good starting ground for the more complex problem.
