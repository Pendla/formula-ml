# Week 16, May 2 - May 8
A major focus has been on the report but also to fix some details needed for running the experiments a bit more sophisticated.

We have requested to get access to cloud computing.

All of us also spend some time to test the program and to get a feel for how it behaved.


## Supervision with Broberg
Stand in for prasad. See "Meeting 160503" for minutes.

## Gabriel
A lot of time went to the report. I wrote an initial version for the racing and simulation sections in theory and method. Wrote a little text for the results of some experiments and planned for the general discussion. It is however difficult to write much since many of the results have not come yet.



## Simon
Made the code runnable on linux, and prepared for running on the cloud server.
