## Week 3, February 1-7
No supervision meeting. We did not think that we had made enough progress since last week.

We decided to be more thorough in our document. This include discussion content, argument, progress, current tasks and problems. We will evaluate the level of ambition at a later time.

### Planning report
Started to stake down the contents of the report and started producing text.

### Implementation

A simple car simulation got implemented. Simple rendering for the car and track were also implemented. 


### Gabriel Alpsten

### Martin Nilsson

Wrote in the method and problem definition chapters of the report. Wrote a lot of the basics of the simulator implementations, ie. window handling, rendering etc.
