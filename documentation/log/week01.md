Set up:

- Git repo. See link on web page

Started literature studies, but nobody have yet had a particular amount of time for it. We have a few relevant sources for machine learning, racing theory and physics. 

We have discussed the problem domain and pinpointed some possibilities and difficulties but we need to investigate possible strategies and techniques much more.

Wrote an initial summary in the report of the progress so far.
