Concerning training algorithms
 - Hill climbing. Use result from simulation to score an AI instance. Stochastically take steps in different directions to increase the overall score. The direction of good steps may be repeated(?).
 - Hebbian learning, Hayken. During a network fire, if to adjacent synapses fire at the same time, increase their weight. If non fire, decrease weight. Back to the simulation as foundation for scoring. But if the simulation prove good behaviour, one might possibly go back in time to empower the behaviour for the previous input.
