# Week 18, May 30 - June 1
This is the final week of the project. All available time was spent on improving our report before the final hand-in.

## Gabriel
A lot of work was spent on the report

I wrote on the sections: 
- racing theory, physics, and motivation for the aspects chosen in the simulator (requested in opposition). The section possibly became a bit long, and is not referred to later in the report as much as it possibly could have, but it is too late to look into now.
- Motivation for the fitness function (requested in opposition)
- Added a short discussion on the usability of the results, as it felt as an important thing to bring up.
- Related works, what we had that was not referred to elsewhere. I frustratingly found a few more papers which I did not have time to look into that seemed very interesting. It is so much more easy to understand contents and relevancy of papers now than earlier in the project, as machine learning is almost completely new to me.
