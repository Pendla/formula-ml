# Week 11, March 28 - April 3
Less tempo due to Easter holy day

## Gabriel 
Read paper: Accelerated Neural Evolution through Cooperatively Coevolved Synapses
Worked with the design of NeatCurveDataExperiment and visualisations.

Experimented with the parameters of the curve experiment. I found that lowering the amount of points decreased the training time. At the same time I increased the spacing of the points so that it would cover about the same part of the track. It also took longer to manage the whole track when the speed of the car increased. Some training data:
s15 d5200 t345 g32
s20 d2000 g20, d2734 g25, d5140 g52 
s25 d1000 g21
s25 d1109 d18, d2736 g29, d3105 g43 t4200, d5150 g46 t7200
s25 d5200 t434 g170
One of five trials at speed 25 succeeded, and the solution found was driving slower than the solution at speeed 15. 

## Daniel
Finished the loading and saving of Generations, and the network can be loaded from an arbitrary location. Though there is still one bug, that is that the Generation count resets when a saved network is loaded.
