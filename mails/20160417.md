OK, no problem.  Just keep at the work, and we’ll review next week.

Hi Prasad!
Sorry for the late mail, but our groups have not found a suitable time. If we cannot meet this week, we will so it next week instead as tomorrow won't result in much.

Best regards

Hi all,

Both Wed and Thu I am busy from maybe 1200-1500.  Most other times this week are ok for me.  Can you guys set up a doodle so we can get slots for both groups later in the week?

Thanks!
Mvh

Hi Prasad! Is it possible to meet later in the week for our group? Members have been abroad so the meeting would be more productive if we could hav 30-45 min on Thursday or Friday.

Hi,

There’s an awkwardness this coming Tuesday. I have a meeting  10-11.   So one way is to book you guys at 0900 and 1100.   Another is to book short meetings from 1100-1200.   I leave it to you to decide whether we need a meeting, long/short, when and where.   (And you’ll have to book the room).  Just let me know by Monday evening.

Thanks!
Mvh
Prasad
