Hi, It seems clear that Thursday 17 Dec at 0830 would be a good time when almost everyone can come. I say 0830 because we don't need more than an hour. At least one person from each group should bring a laptop and take notes. I'll get back re venue. It will

Hi Prassad, Feel free to use the Doodle for the other group. We do not know much about the procedures so far, so we will do what you think is best. /Daniel Daniel Eineving Lindströmsgatan 3D 412 61 Göteborg Sweden Mobile Phone: +46768455574 E-mail: daniel@eineving.se
