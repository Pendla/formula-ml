I’m not sure about my schedule today, so let’s leave it for tomorrow.  But I’m glad to hear of the progress.

Hi Prasad!

Do you want to have our presentation slides and demo-video latar today? Or do you want to wait and see it at the presentation slot. The AI can now drive the car at a slow pace through curves, but fails when a reaching a sequence of sharp curves. So we have some progress to display at the presentation tomorrow.

Best regards
Daniel Eineving
