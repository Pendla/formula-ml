Hi!

We are so sad to hear about this and wish you safe travel. 
 
Regarding the progress of our group we agree with what you wrote in your mail Prasad. We have a clear plan and target for the last weeks of development. The supervision would benefit us most if the focus would be on the presentation and report. Having Niklas for an hour of supervision would be great when you are away, as I believe he have read our Planning Paper.
 
 

Best regards
Daniel Eineving

Hi Niklas,

My journey is now booked.  We leave Mon 25 Apr and return Mon 9 May (two weeks).  The week starting 2 May is a short week because of Ascension Day 5 May and the klämdag on 6 May.

My two student groups and I have typically been meeting once a week for an hour.    So I expect they will want to see you once or twice while I’m away.  

Roughly, the status for both groups is that they are for now concentrating on finishing up the programming, aiming for the biggest bang for the buck.  Pluck all the low hanging fruit, etc.  Report writing hasn’t started formally yet, but they should be well aware of how to go about it, we have discussed that often enough.  It will be good to see what you make of their progress so far.

I will be away but reachable by email, so please don’t hesitate to get in touch.
 

Mvh
Prasad

Hi Prasad,

I'm very sorry to hear of your mother's difficulties, and naturally you will want to go and be with her.

It is difficult at this stage in the process to introduce a secondary supervisor, unless there is already someone who the students have interacted with within the scope of the project. If not, I think the simplest and smoothest fix would be for me as examiner to step in as temporary supervisor, to the best of my ability. Daniel, Jonathan, feel free to contact me to coordinate with me what your needs are.

Best regards, Niklas

Hi all,

My mother is in hospital, and while the last reports said she was better, it is all very uncertain, as one might expect with an aged and frail person.  it may be that I will leave fairly soon for a week or so, to go there and cheer her up.

As we are approaching the end, do you think we need a temporary supervisor?  How would that work?

Mvh
Prasad
